Several experts and studies have warned of the danger of spreading SARS-CoV-2 droplets in confined spaces like gyms, especially since exercise causes heavy breathing. In areas with poor ventilation like internet cafes, studies have found droplets carrying the virus to linger longer as limited air flow hinders their dispersal.

Government officials earlier let gyms and other types of establishments reopen under GCQ starting August 1. This was met with opposition from doctors who appealed for a review of the measure as cases surged.

The affected businesses, at the time, were able to reopen for only 3 days – August 1 to 3 – as Metro Manila and nearby areas were again placed under the stricter modified enhanced community quarantine from August 4 to 18.

The coronavirus task force then backtracked on its decision to allow the reopening of gyms and other establishments under GCQ, so these businesses stayed closed under the "strict" GCQ from August 19 to 31.

Gyms and other establishments are only currently allowed to operate under modified GCQ, the loosest form of community quarantine.
